Letters A-G are notes with their usual names, upper and lower case represent different octaves, (3 represents that the "base octave" goes one up. Numbers are the lengths of the notes, z's are silences. The fact that numbers are lengths is easy to deduce given the fact that it is all 4/4, it is specially easy in the last one. 

Resistir√© was the easiest and I kind of was expecting it, The Pink Panther was a bit more complicated but not that much (the most difficult part was guessing the exact title with "The" included and without "theme" or "song"). With Imagine I had to really think a lot since it is very difficult to recognize without the chords, and because I had not understood well the meaning of "(3" (I thought it only affected the next note). Once you get that, the second part is recognizable.
