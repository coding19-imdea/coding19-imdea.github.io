<h2 id="problem-0-quadratic-primes">Problem 0: Quadratic primes</h2>
<p>Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: 
 \[n^2+n+41\]</p>
<p>It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values \( 0 \leq n \leq 39 \). 
However, when \(n=40\), \(402 + 40 + 41 = 40 (40 + 1) + 41\) is divisible by \(41\), 
and certainly when \(n=41\), \(412+41+41\) is clearly divisible by \(41\).</p>
<p>The incredible formula \( n^2 − 79n + 1601 \) was discovered, 
which produces \(80\) primes for the consecutive values \(0 \leq n \leq 79\). 
The product of the coefficients, \(−79\) and \(1601\), is \(−126479\).</p>
<p>Considering quadratics of the form:
\[n^2 + an + b\], where \(|a| \leq 1000 \) and \(|b| \leq 1000\)</p>
<p>where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
e.g. (\ | 11| = 11 \) and \( |−4| = 4\)
Find the product of the coefficients, \(a\) and \(b\), for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of \(n\), 
starting with \(n=0\).</p>
