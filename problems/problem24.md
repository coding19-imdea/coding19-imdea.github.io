# Make It Ring a Bell

## Preamble
Remember [problem 21](./problem21) and how it could have been a hard-core hacking task? This is it.

## The Problem

Write a program that can read [abc](http://abcnotation.com/blog/2010/01/31/how-to-understand-abc-the-basics/), the musical notation language, and can play it. Submit your code on the coding19 channel together with a quick screencast of what it can do.

There are many MIDI libraries available. The amount of required musical background can be learned within an hour. 

**Lockdown-style challenge:** Generate your own abc theme and use the coding19 channel to challenge (a specific or all the participants) to convert it to music! 

**Additional challenge:** If you are using a statically typed programming language: can you use typing rules to enforce patterns such as metrics, e.g. that the total length count in a bar corresponds to the required meter?

Can you play Paddy O'Rafferty?
